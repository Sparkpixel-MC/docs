To view chunk boundaries in the world, you can use F3+G to display chunk borders. All chunks in the world are by default &quot;Wilderness&quot;, where all players on the server can build, destroy, access doors, chests, etc. PvP is enabled in the wilderness.</p><p><strong>Towny Day</strong> is a real-world day. Towny operates by town days. The start of each town day is displayed in the chat bar.</p><p><strong>Town</strong> is a collection of players (called residents, at least <u>1</u> person) under a certain town name. A town can enclose chunks from the wilderness as its own to protect them from other players. The chunks that a town takes from the wilderness are called territories or town plots. Town plots can be unowned by any resident - these are called unowned town plots, or owned by residents - these are called resident plots.</p><p><strong>Resident</strong> refers to a player who belongs to any town. The first player to create a town is called the Mayor. Each town has a mayor, who is the owner of the town and can access all town plots within their town as well as all related commands. The mayor can also let other residents help handle town affairs by granting them town ranks.</p><p>Town <strong>Bank</strong> is a virtual storage repository for town funds; only the mayor and vice mayor can withdraw funds from the town bank, but all residents can deposit funds into it. The mayor and vice mayor can also view the bank transaction history of their town bank for the current town day by entering <code>/t bankhistory</code>.</p><p>The normal operation of a town requires &quot;<strong>paying taxes</strong>&quot;. The server will charge fees to all town banks at the beginning of each town day to allow the town to continue operating. On this server, if the town&#39;s bank balance is insufficient to maintain its existence, the town will enter a &quot;<strong>bankrupt</strong>&quot; state, and the bank will start to incur debt. After entering bankruptcy, some functions of the town will be restricted. Any resident can deposit money into the bank during this period to lift the bankruptcy state. A town can remain in bankruptcy for a maximum of <u>30</u> days. After this period or if the debt reaches the maximum limit, the town will be deleted.</p><p>In addition to taxes required by the server, towns that join a nation must pay nation taxes to the affiliated nation; residents who own town plots must pay plot taxes to the town mayor; any resident must pay town taxes to the town.</p><p>Towns that cannot pay nation taxes will be removed from the nation; residents who cannot pay plot taxes will lose their plots; residents who cannot pay town taxes (<strong>except assistants</strong>) will be removed from the town.</p><p><strong>Nation</strong> is a collection of towns (at least <u>1</u>), and all residents of all towns in the nation are members of that nation.</p><h2 id="town-creation-and-player-management" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#town-creation-and-player-management"><span>Town Creation and Player Management</span></a></h2><p>To create your town, use <code>/t new (your town name)</code> or <code>/t create (your town name)</code>. This operation will deduct funds from your balance. Town names only accept <u>English letters, numbers, and English underscores</u>.</p><p>After creating a town, you will also be appointed as the town&#39;s mayor.

As mayor, you can also use <code>/t kick (player name)</code> to kick residents from the town.</p><p>A town <strong>does not allow</strong> <strong>anyone</strong> outside the town to access its territory, <u>only</u> residents of your own town can. If you also <strong>do not want</strong> <u>residents</u> to use the town freely, you can now <strong>prevent</strong> them from accessing by simply executing <code>/t set perm off</code>. <u>Your residents and you</u> can purchase your own land to use, <strong>separate</strong> from public town space and others!</p><h3 id="territory-claiming" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#territory-claiming"><span>Territory Claiming</span></a></h3><p>Claiming is the process of <u>taking a chunk</u> from the wilderness and <strong>adding</strong> it to <u>your town</u> to expand and protect your land. All chunks occupied by your town are called territories or town plots. When you create a town, you claim the chunk you are standing on.</p><p>To claim a chunk, stand on a wilderness chunk adjacent to your existing territory and enter <code>/t claim</code>. This operation will <strong>deduct funds</strong> from the <u>town bank</u>.</p><p>To claim a chunk not adjacent to your existing territory, enter <code>/t claim outpost</code>. This operation deducts more funds from the <u>town bank</u> than claiming adjacent chunks.</p><p>Then you can enter <code>/t claim</code> as usual to claim adjacent chunks. Each separate territory group is called a &quot;<strong>town outpost</strong>&quot;. The first chunk claimed in a town outpost is called the &quot;<strong>town outpost home chunk</strong>&quot;, and your position in the claimed chunk is called the &quot;<strong>town outpost spawn point</strong>&quot;.</p><p>To remove/give up (or &quot;<strong>abandon</strong>&quot;) the chunk you are standing on from your town, use <code>/t unclaim</code>. Giving up the last chunk of a town outpost will also delete that town outpost.</p><p>There is a limit on the number of territories a town can have at any time. This limit is determined by <u>town size</u>.</p><p>Town Size</p><p>Town size is the ratio of the number of territories a town owns to the maximum number of territories it may have. You can view town size on the town info screen (&quot;/t&quot;). The number of available chunks your town can claim can be increased through three territory bonuses.</p><p>Losing town residents and losing nation members means you will also lose the corresponding territory bonuses in town size.</p><p>The exact values of town size and territory bonuses are listed at the bottom of this guide.</p><h3 id="town-upkeep-costs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#town-upkeep-costs"><span>Town Upkeep Costs</span></a></h3><p>Town upkeep is the amount automatically deducted from your town bank at the <u>beginning</u> of each <strong>Towny day</strong> to allow the town to continue existing. Not having enough funds in the town bank to pay upkeep means your town will <strong>fall</strong>. The <u>more</u> town plots, the <u>higher</u> the town <strong>upkeep will be<u> per day</u></strong>.</p><p>In Towny, residents can manually transfer funds from their balance to the town bank at any time using <code>/t deposit (amount)</code>.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>In a nation, the above command can only be used on your town&#39;s home chunk or bank plot.</p></div><p>Generally, it is <strong>important</strong> to consider town upkeep when <u>planning a town</u>. A very large town with unnecessary territories will be unnecessarily expensive compared to a smaller, well-organized town.</p><h3 id="buying-and-owning-plots" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#buying-and-owning-plots"><span>Buying and Owning Plots</span></a></h3><p>Each resident of your town (including the mayor) can own town plots, where they can have their own building and usage space, the size of which <u>depends on</u> what the mayor can or wants to give, and other residents usually cannot access. Town plots owned by residents are called their resident plots. Residents have full access to their own resident plots and all related commands. Residents can <strong>own multiple and separate</strong> resident plots.</p><p>Residents <strong>must</strong> purchase town plots first to make them their own resident plots.</p><p><strong>Mayor</strong> to withdraw plot sales, can enter <code>/plot notforsale</code>.</p><p>Residents can use <code>/plot unclaim</code> while standing on one of their owned resident plots to <strong>remove</strong> their ownership (&quot;<strong>abandon</strong>&quot; their resident plot).</p><p>Residents owning their own land is a necessary function of any town, as the land residents use for building and protecting items is separated from public town land. Well-organized towns usually allow each resident to have resident plots in convenient locations around the town, and all resident plots are close to or adjacent to each other. This is strongly recommended for easier town management!</p><h3 id="town-spawn-point" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#town-spawn-point"><span>Town Spawn Point</span></a></h3><p>Each town has a home chunk, which exists because a town must always own <u>at least</u> one claimed chunk. When you create a town, the chunk you are standing on becomes the first home chunk, and your exact position becomes the first town spawn point. The town spawn point is located within the home chunk and is indicated by particles on the ground.</p><p>The location of the home chunk and town spawn point can be changed by the mayor. To change the location of the home chunk and where people teleport when using <code>/t spawn</code>, you need to first execute <code>/t set homeblock</code>, then execute <code>/t set spawn</code>. Your exact position will be the new town spawn point.</p><p>The home chunk is equivalent to the concept of &quot;<strong>town center</strong>&quot;. The location of the town spawn point and home chunk is best placed in the center of the town, where residents can quickly access the rest of the town.</p><h3 id="joining-a-nation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#joining-a-nation"><span>Joining a Nation</span></a></h3><p>Being part of a nation has many benefits for a town. Towns that join a nation can obtain more claimable chunks and gain various other gameplay benefits related to economy, influence, communication, and community. Towns that join a nation may also have to pay daily town nation taxes from their town banks - in addition to upkeep. The town nation taxes your town pays each day are set by the <strong>nation leader</strong> and can be viewed by entering <code>towny prices</code> (at the bottom).</p><p>Generally, your town can join a nation after being <u>invited</u>. The mayor can accept the nation invitation by entering <code>/accept (name of inviting nation)</code> or <strong>reject</strong> the invitation by entering <code>/deny (name of inviting nation)</code>.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>On the other hand, if you don&#39;t want to join other nations, you can also create your own nation! Creating and managing nations will be introduced later in this guide (this section is to be completed)</p></div><p>Each plot has permissions, which <u>allow or deny</u> certain players from performing certain actions in it. In wilderness chunks, all permissions are enabled for every player on the server, and this cannot be changed. Permissions are the reason why Towny as a plugin can protect your buildings, chests, etc. within towns. Correctly configuring the permissions of town plots is important so that only those you want to access the town plot can have these permissions.</p><p>You can view your town&#39;s permission settings on the town info screen. You can view the permission settings of individual plots on the plot info screen (<code>/plot info</code>).</p><p>When viewing permissions, if a group is denied that permission type, it will display as a dash <strong>&quot;-&quot;</strong>. If the group is allowed that permission type, it will display the first letter of its name. These groups are called &quot;<strong>permission levels</strong>&quot;.</p><h4 id="configuring-permissions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configuring-permissions"><span>Configuring Permissions</span></a></h4><p>The permission types, permission levels, and permission categories are explained below.</p><h5 id="permission-types" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#permission-types"><span>Permission Types</span></a></h5><p>Each of the 4 permission types is related to different actions.</p><h6 id="permission-levels" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#permission-levels"><span>Permission Levels</span></a></h6><p>Permission levels are similar to the concept of groups, and they have a hierarchy.

The town bank balance can <strong>continue below 0</strong> because funds are deducted from it due to upkeep or nation taxes. The value of the town bank below 0 during bankruptcy mode is called its &quot;<strong>debt</strong>&quot;. The debt limit or debt cap is the maximum possible debt a town can have in bankruptcy mode before being deleted, and it is calculated based on the number of territories the town owns. The debt cap can be viewed on the town information screen.</p><p>During bankruptcy mode, the town faces some <strong>restrictions</strong>.</p><p>To exit bankruptcy mode, sufficient funds must be deposited into the town bank to eliminate the debt (<code>/t deposit</code>).
